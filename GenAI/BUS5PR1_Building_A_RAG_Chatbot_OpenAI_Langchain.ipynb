It involves analyzing current and historical data to make predictions about future events or trends.\\n\\nPredictive analytics can be used in various industries and applications, such as forecasting sales, predicting customer behavior, optimizing marketing campaigns, detecting fraud, and improving operational efficiency. By leveraging predictive analytics, organizations can make more informed decisions, anticipate future trends, and gain a competitive advantage.\\n\\nThe process of predictive analytics typically involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Define the problem: Clearly define the business problem or question that you want to address with predictive analytics.\\n\\n2. Data collection: Gather relevant data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and external sources.\\n\\n3. Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.\\n\\n4. Feature selection and engineering: Identify the most relevant variables (features) that will be used to build the predictive model. You may also create new features based on existing data.\\n\\n5. Model selection: Choose an appropriate predictive modeling technique, such as regression, classification, or clustering, based on the nature of the problem and the type of data.\\n\\n6. Model training: Train the predictive model using historical data to learn the patterns and relationships in the data.\\n\\n7. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\\n\\n8. Model deployment: Deploy the predictive model to make predictions on new data and integrate it into business processes or applications.\\n\\nOverall, predictive analytics can help organizations make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and improve outcomes by leveraging the power of data and analytics.'"

        "**Creating a Retriever:** The retriever is an object that allows us to search through a vector store (which stores embeddings of documents or text chunks) and find the most relevant documents or text based on a given query. The retriever’s job is to return a subset of documents that best match the query based on similarity of their embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Setting top_k = 5:** The variable top_k is set to 5, which defines the number of results (documents or text chunks) the retriever should return from the vector store. In this case, when you perform a search or query using the retriever, it will return the top 5 most similar documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reason for using k: **In machine learning, k is commonly used to represent the number of nearest neighbors or results that should be returned from a search. When we perform a search in a vector database, the system compares the embedding of the query with the stored document embeddings to find the closest matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "**By specifying k = 5,** we limit the results to only the top 5 most similar embeddings. This is useful because retrieving too many results may introduce noise, while retrieving too few may omit valuable information. The choice of k balances relevance and result quantity, helping to ensure that the top 5 most relevant results are retrieved for the query, offering better performance and accuracy for tasks like question-answering or document search.\n",
        "\n",
        "**vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": top_k}):** This line converts the vector store into a retriever object by passing search_kwargs={\"k\": top_k}. The search_kwargs argument allows you to specify additional search parameters for the retriever—in this case, limiting the number of results to the top 5 using the k value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is k Important?**\n",
        "* **Efficiency**: Limiting the number of retrieved documents improves efficiency. You don't need to process or rank too many results, which could slow down response time.\n",
        "* **Relevance**: Instead of returning all possible matches, we retrieve only the top k (5 in this case) results, ensuring that the returned documents are the most relevant and not overwhelming the system with irrelevant data.\n",
        "* **Performance**: Focusing on a smaller number of high-quality matches makes it easier to integrate with downstream systems like question-answering modules, which can then provide more accurate responses without unnecessary computation.\n",

This increase in rental assistance aims to support individuals and families facing housing affordability challenges.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Cheaper Medicines: The budget includes measures to provide cheaper medicines as part of an up to $3 billion agreement with community pharmacies. This initiative aims to make essential medications more affordable for Australians.\n",

            "5. Student Debt Waiver: The budget includes the waiving of $3 billion in student debt for more than 3 million Australians to make student loans fairer. This measure aims to alleviate the financial burden on individuals with outstanding student loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Superannuation on Government-funded Paid Parental Leave: $1.1 billion has been allocated to pay superannuation on Government-funded Paid Parental Leave. This initiative aims to support parents by ensuring they receive superannuation contributions during parental leave.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Emergency and Food Relief Funding: $138 million has been allocated to boost funding for emergency and food relief, as well as financial support services. This funding aims to provide assistance to individuals and families facing financial hardship.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Supporting Wages Growth: The budget includes measures to support wages growth through submissions to the Fair Work Commission and supporting pay rises for care sector workers. This initiative aims to improve the financial well-being of workers in key sectors.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. Freeze on Deeming Rates: The budget extends the freeze on deeming rates for 876,000 income support recipients. This measure aims to provide additional financial support to individuals receiving income support.\n",
