We begin by taking a YouTube video URL, from which the audio is extracted and transcribed using Whisper, OpenAI's automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. This transcription is then vectorized using ChromaDB, a high-performance vector database, effectively transforming the unstructured text data into a structured, queryable form. Finally, Langchain is utilized to provide a natural language interface for querying the stored vector data, allowing users to extract meaningful information from the video content.\n","\n","## Table of Contents\n","\n","1.

I don't want to ever think that we don't have enough time for art.  If the challenge is to bring complexity to our perception,  there is no better way than to do that with art.  That's what experiencing art is,  is responding to complex relational processes,  exploring the boundaries of our perception,  making sense in new ways.  And it includes our intellect, our imagination, our memories.  It includes the body, it includes emotions.  These things are not separable, of course, of course.  And yet, in so much of our other discussion and analysis,  the first thing we do is separate them.  So we need the arts.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And especially for this upcoming session,  which is about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  day, and we have quite a project in addressing this subject. Arguably the UN SDGs have offered  a platform and a visual, a graphic, a language. It's offered this collection of 17 identified  issues, has offered an entry point that is an interesting entry point into this question  of how do we address the global situations at local levels, or local situations at global\n","0.5 - 7.55 min\n"," levels, or both. So there's no question that it will be impossible to deal with any of  the SDGs if we don't have a mindset change to recognize that that's necessary. So that's  a given. And from there, I think that the best thing to do is to start with Petra, who  will give us her, some of her experience in working with it, and we'll take it from there.  Again, each person's going to give a 10 minute, not more, please, input, and then we will  open it up to discussion. And your job is to not get mad at me if I don't call on you  immediately. It's hard for me to find everyone, okay?  Thank you. Thank you, Nora. And thank you, Elizabeth has gone. I must say, the music  really touched me, and also the film. It reminded me of a very good friend in South Africa of  mine, who was a member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. And she one day sat, you know,  and was sitting on my veranda. Petra, the most important thing that I learned in the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission is that people who commit atrocities have denied themselves  their own humanity. That's why they do what they do. And so we do a lot of atrocities  to each other and to the planet. So humanity and coming back to our shared humanity is  at the core, and it's not an unimportant aspect. So, can we have the PowerPoint? Great. So this is  about stewarding sustainability transformation. I would like to quickly go back. I'm following  on to Johan Rockström. You remember he ended with, we need to steward the transformation.  I'm also referring to the last session on mindset shift, because there is something we need to  integrate between self-mindset, between process, how do we do things, and between systems. And I'm  going to concentrate a little bit more on the process, you know, on the how do we actually do  this. So, just like to go a little bit back, I would like to honor Maya Gopal with her book  Great Mindshift, because she said transformation means radical, incremental change, and it's not  a contradiction. So we look at the situation in the world, and we know how it looks like, and this  is collective action, by the way. But this is not the kind of collective action that we're looking  for, and I just want to be careful. I'm using the term a lot, but it needs to be contextualized. So  the collective action that we want is a little bit more like this, you know. We want people to  communicate, collaborate, and at the core of SDG transformation is people need to own their  own future. There are no losers in the world. People need to own the future and need to shape  the future collectively. So that's at the core of my work, and I would like to kind of just quote  Grace Lee Box. Those of you who don't know Grace Lee Box, she is a relatively famous American  revolutionary, there are some. She turned 100 in 2015 and passed away a couple of days afterwards.  She wrote fantastic books, and this quote is from her. The new paradigm we must establish is about  creating systems that bring out the best in each other, and that's what we need to go about. So the  SDGs are actually a good step forward. The people who invented the visual, I think, were genius,  because what they did, they created something that is alive, that the people can identify with,  and they can run with this. There is no IP on the visual. People can kind of get the tiles and put  them together in a different way. There is a bit of a style guide, you know, but otherwise people  can run with it. And I have this municipality that we are working with in the Netherlands,  the smallest municipality in the Netherlands, and they have created a global goal academy,  and they have said we are the first municipality in the Netherlands, maybe in the world, I don't  know. And for us, the SDGs are the core of what we do. We have a network, we shift into a network  organisation, we have SDG ambassadors, we work with schools and with other municipalities,  we work with enterprises, etc., and they are fired up, and you know what? People have fun. So SDG  implementation can be more than a technical implementation challenge, it can be fun. It is,  and that's at the core, the issue is human agency, and do we understand a little bit more about human  agency? First question is what can we learn from successful transformation processes? I grew up in  Berlin, and on our daily ride to my school, I was passing the death strip, and in the village that I  lived in Berlin, in West Berlin, I could hear the shootings from the border. And for me, this was a  system I grew up with until I was close to 30, that could not be changed. And that was, that way, I was  told when I was a child, the system can't be changed. It did, it did, it did, but not just by itself.\n","7.55 - 12.86 min\n"," Quite interesting, in a mix between stewarding, there were a lot of people stewarding this,  and it looked like an accident. It wasn't, and people have never gone any, any thank you for that.  A lot of people were stewarding that, and a lot of people are still stewarding this today, 30 years  after this happened. So it needs collective stewardship, and it needs self-organization.  And I would like to just go a little bit to, there are many examples that I'm working with, like, be it  kind of cross-border trade, Afghanistan-Pakistan, be it integration of, of eastern Balkan countries  into the European Union, be it like, like water management in Tunisia, or climate action plans in  Georgia. So it's everywhere we work, it is about collective stewardship, and it's about collective  action, and, and getting people to understand the future. I would like to zoom in a little bit into,  into Tunisia. Imagine Tunisia, countryside, drought, huge drought problem, a government that  has changed, you know, where the old structures are still in place, the new structures haven't  really materialized, and there are attacks by the IS. And a lot of young people are recruited for the IS,  Cairo, in southern Tunisia. And now, this collective stewardship around water as an SDG  took place as a two-year process, where it was about getting people into conversation that were  fighting with each other, like, no tomorrow. The, the farmers were stealing water, the government people  thought the farmers were criminals, indeed farmers, farmers stole water from the pipelines,  no communication, nothing, no communication between the government departments, everything was stuck.  And it was possible in a two-year process, and this becomes now quite technical, to steward, that people  took up shaping their future collectively, nobody else could be doing it for them, they did it  themselves. It was about getting the government departments into a conversation first, they  couldn't talk with the farmers, getting the farmers into conversation with each other, the different  kind of associations, etc. It was getting NGOs involved, and it was about stewarding a top-down  and bottom-up process, and that is one of the most important lessons on transformative processes.  So, what can we learn? Transformative change works when it attends to systems aliveness. Suddenly,  people have the feeling they can shape their future. They were desperate in Cairo, but they had  the feeling they can shape their future. And suddenly, the government officials thought, oh,  you know, maybe we should talk with the, with the farmers. And interesting enough, it was the  farmers who said, you know, can we work with the government together on a water charter? That's  what I, what they did. Two, two years later, 800 people in the room, and there were tears, because  they said, for the first time, this happened, that we can create a future together that's different.  But it was tangible. There were working groups, there were policies on irrigation, there were  policies on drinking water, etc. So, there were lots of tangible issues, but it was about getting  the human agency together. So, we worked with a compass that, you know, some of you might be  familiar with or not, but the interesting thing about this compass is that it's a guide. It's an  action tool that people can understand. It looks complex, but it's easy to work with, and it has  humanity as one of the most important criteria. So, whatever process you set up, there are questions  on relationship building, there are questions on empathy, there are questions on mindfulness,  and people can work with it. It, it works. So, it is really about shaping the future together. It's  about looking who needs to be engaged in the process. What are the existing innovations,  actually, that we can build on, that we don't ignore? What is it that touches people's hearts,  you know, what creates meaning? Because that's what gets people going. And it is about looking  at differences in expertise and getting people into a conversation that usually don't talk with  each other. And it was about relating to a, a bigger system and say, you know, who are we doing this for,  you know, what's the bigger system? So, and that creates an alive system, a more resilient system,  and a system where a self-stewardship of the future can take place. So, the next lesson is,  it transformations need these orchestrated, stewarded processes between different actors.  And this is just kind of a quick shot, you can't read it, but it gets as complicated as it gets.  This is about sustainable fishery. And, you know, you have a multiple actors, international actors,  local actors, municipalities, NGOs, government, etc., fisheries, fisheries associations, and, you know,  like we may have difficulties in, in communicating, collaborating in the Club of Rome, they also have\n","12.87 - 17.99 min\n"," difficulties, you know, and they, but they need to get things going. And this is just with a bit of  support of creating processes that really work. So, it is about multi-stakeholder, it's about multi-level,  and these have to be coming together. So, these different initiatives have to work together.  Single initiatives, single projects are not going to work. So, if we look at the larger systems,  because the issue is that the project approach that we take is not enough, we need to go into  larger systems change, and that's where we actually need to ask different questions, and we need to  look at what is the biggest system, and how can this integrate into transformation systems. So, we  need to move from a project approach to a multi-stakeholder partnership approach, but we are  at the cusp of moving into identifying with transformation systems. So, thank you for that,  and this is all kind of written up in the next report to the Club of Rome. Thank you.  Thank you very much, Petra. Our next speaker will be Hans, and while he's getting ready, I would just  like to speak to something that Timoyo brought up this morning around the ant's eyes and the  bird's eyes, this process of zooming in and zooming out, the details and the patterns, and how  important that is in this process. Are you ready, Hans? I'm ready. All right. It's not there yet, but  I have a few words to say before. Okay, go ahead then. Yeah, good afternoon. Great pleasure to be here,  and thanks for the invitation. I'm a member of the Club of Rome for about like two and a half, three  years now, but the first time I really get practically involved, and throughout yesterday and  so far today, you know, sort of wondering, okay, what are we here for? And you can see that I put  my sleeve back, so the jacket is also left behind, because we need action, and we heard this many  times, and I think there's a lot of things we know how to do, so we need to go out there and do them.  We still need to talk about the bigger picture, as we talked yesterday and today, but eventually  things are happening out there. It's getting warmer, and I think somebody has to do something. So, that's  what I thought we need to move with, and we have now been given this universal  framework, the SDGs, and I think that this is really the first time on a universal, on a global level, we  have a framework, a legal framework. People have actually committed, 193 countries have committed  to this. So, I mean, we can talk about many other things we need to do, but that's the one thing I  think everyone needs to concentrate now, to really to move ahead. Oh, I'm in charge here, actually.  So, just to say that what I'm talking about is the experience of work we have done in this, what, 40  plus countries already. So, I want to talk a little bit about sort of what we do. Now, most of the,  when you go out there, about talk about SDGs, you go to government, civil society, even the private  sector, they are paralyzed by this complexity. They say, well, how can we deal with these 169 targets,  242 indicators, and this is an excuse not to get started or to do something. They say, oh,  how are we going to do it, who is going to do it, and actually most government we go and try to work  with, for example, they don't even have a place where somebody is in charge. So, we are already three  years into the process, and many countries, in particular the developed ones, have no place  exactly where we can go to actually start and discuss how are we going to go about it.  And so, this complexity here is really paralyzing people, and I think we can do  better, and we have tools to really move on with that.  I'm sure, oh,  going on, oh, okay. So, this is actually what you find, you really go to government silos. We all have talked  about silos, and so how do we actually change something about these silos? Because right now,  what's happening in many places is each silo takes their own goal and say, okay, I'm going to do it.  Not really thinking about, you know, what about doing it together? And I think in order to do  things together, you need tools, and that's, I think, what we have been trying to do. And there's  a tool in a toolbox which will help deal with this issue, this big challenge on how are we  going to deal with 17 goals to make this sustainable development. And the question is, how much resources,  where to put them, when, and where's the money coming from? So, everybody's always complaining  it costs more money. Actually, it's the governments who say, all right, we put all the money we have  now on the side, and now rearrange everything, not complaining that we need more money. That's what  you hear all the time. No, start from new. There's so much waste everywhere. So, again, using models,\n","17.99 - 23.24 min\n"," you can actually start from zero. And so, what we have done, this is thing you can actually  download it and play around with, it's called the ISDG. It's actually a development of the World  Tree model of 40 some years later. What's the machine behind it? And basically, what you do is,  there are, I'm not sure if there's a pointer here. No. Oh, sorry. Whatever. So, you can click on a goal,  whatever that may be, infrastructure, and then you have options, and you have policies, choices.  How much money are you going to put in this? Close the box, go to any other goal you want to,  choose other policies, and within a few seconds on your laptop, you can recalculate a new scenario  and see how you move versus the business as usual. And what's interesting is that actually,  what happens here, and that tool, anyone can use it, what happens is the red line is the business  as usual, and the blue one is what have you now done better with investments in whatever that was  like in the infrastructure. But you can actually add as many as you want and play around. If you're  not able to have money in your bank account, this model will stop. If there's not enough resources,  it will stop. So, it actually is connected to many, many 150 databases in the background.  And the results can be presented many different ways, like this wheel here, everybody's got the  little pin here, all right? So, you can have the base scenario, you can have the scenario for the  national strategy, which many countries already have, or you can say, we're going to have a new  SDG strategy, and you can even see how much more money it will take than what you already have  to meet the targets within the time we have, 2030. The other interesting thing about  using models to help our mind, because we are limited in how many variables we can handle,  right? Three or four, something like that. So, the model is several thousands, and you can then see  where do you get the positive synergies and where you get negative. And so, you can optimize the use  of your funding. And that's all, actually, for each scenario, you can just look at what you're doing.  Now, the process is important, because what you want to do is not having only the government,  do that in a little place somewhere, you want to do that with the stakeholders. The SDGs are  meant to be inclusive and integrated and multi-stakeholder. And so, the way to do this is  actually to take this model out, go to the people and work with the people. The model actually is  customized to each country with the multi-stakeholder, so it reflects exactly what's happening in the  country and the wishes, etc., for the country. And so, it's a process of going around in a spiral,  where as you go, you get better. You get more people involved in the process. And actually,  even more people will be involved very soon, because November 1st, in Geneva, we're going to launch  the smartphone and the tablet version of this model, so that more people can get involved.  More people can actually look at what would happen if we do this or that. People can come with all  kinds of ideas, and that's the way, I think at least, we can move forward, because we have to get  the people involved. They have to become part of the work we need to do. And here again, so in summary,  if you look at government, NGOs, development partners, they also need to have these tools  in that toolbox, where there's many other tools to actually work on these SDGs. To look at  the current performance. Who has looked at that? And if you look at the current performance,  look at that business as usual. It is lousy, almost in every country. Very bad. So we need to improve  that. So then you can evaluate the alternative, again, with the model, and you can do policy coherence.  That's what the... It's really something which, unless we have it, we're going to waste more money, and we'll  miss all the targets, and we'll go on fry, as we have seen or heard in the last few days. And again, if you  want the people to come around the table, you have to give something they can play with, they can look  at immediately. Not a report coming out in a week's time, after somebody cranked some numbers nobody  understands. And that's, I think, one of the ways to really successfully fulfill the national  development plans, and get to the results we expect for the 2030 agenda. So I think we have the tools, we  have many tools in our toolbox, let them put together, let's work together. Because that's another  problem. You know, everybody comes up with their own little thing. And just look at the UN website, you have  all these different things which do not really work together, unfortunately. So I think we need to see  there's a hierarchy of tools, and they need to start to work together. So to me, I think we have  what we need, let's just put it to work as soon as possible. And make this complexity which is out\n","23.24 - 28.54 min\n"," there manageable. And we can do it, because we all know by system dynamics, these are the tools,  have been developed a long time ago, let's put them to use. Thank you.  Thank you, Hans. And our next speaker is Enrico.  Just reflecting right away, remembering that there was this moment that you brought up, Petra, of how  impossible it was to deal with the Berlin Wall. And also recognizing in Hans this question of the  impossibility of dealing with complexity. And we've gotten over it before. So Enrico, tell us what's  happening in Europe. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I would like to have, yes, great.  I'm very happy to speak here on behalf of the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development,  which is one of the co-organizers of this event. And as you were able to put down the wall,  we were able to put Italians together, which is almost as difficult as destroying the Berlin Wall,  let me say in this way. I will focus on a few points, but I just say that I fell in love with  the limits of growth when I was a student, second year of university in economics. And since then,  I decided to try to become an economist to save the world. And so I'm very honored to be part of  the Club of Rome and speak this afternoon. I was involved in the preparation of the Agenda 2030.  Ban Ki-moon asked me to run a task force on the issue of data and not just indicators in preparation  and also the European Commission. But let me briefly describe what ASVIS is. It is, according  to what we have seen around the world, an almost unique experience because we are bringing together  more than 220 organizations, not individual organizations. Most of them are associations,  business associations, trade unions, and so on and so forth. So we are covering almost all parts  of Italy and we work on a wide range of issues and we are completely funded by ourselves and our  members, plus some sponsorships. This is what we do. We are already in all Italian schools,  33,000 teachers have taken our e-course, 58,000 will do it next year in cooperation with the  Ministry of Education, even with the previous government. We have established the network of  59 universities for sustainable development who are changing now their curricula and not only their  managerial way of managing the university. We are doing master's also for journalists, for  managers in public administrations. We do a lot of different activities and we also do statistical  research and modeling. One of the main activities is the organization of the Italian Festival of  Sustainable Development. 17 days all over the country we had this year 700 events. It is a  unique experience worldwide as far as we know. But what we do is also policy making and institutional  building. We have now in the Italian Parliament a proposal to change the constitution and put  the concept of sustainable development in the constitution because this is about intergenerational  equity that does not exist almost in any constitution around the world. I'm very keen that  France, Switzerland, Belgium, Norway did it recently and I'm very proud that there is a proposal at the  parliament now. We have designed and then given to the former prime minister a directive for the  Italian government and we hope that the new government will implement it. I met the prime  minister a few days ago. We have taken the beyond GDP indicators that the movement I launched when  I was chief statistician of the OECD in 2004. We embed them now in the budget law and the government  before adopting the budget law have to simulate the impact of policies on CO2 emissions, inequality,  poverty, gender balance, crime and so on and so forth. This is part of our law now. We are trying  to change. We have built a parliamentarian intergroup on sustainable development and we are  doing many other things. We had most of the current parties signing 10 points manifesto before  the elections and now we are pushing for their implementation. We published an annual report,  copies are available there, also an executive summary in English and this has also in my view  a very important tool. You cannot communicate anything with 242 indicators, nothing. So what we  have tried to do is to build these composite indicators out of 150 indicators and you have  a dashboard with 17 indicators and now we have it also at regional level and almost at city level  and through this you can understand what's going on but it doesn't tell you how much is missing  from the end of the 230. We also do modelling through a model established, developed by the  Eni Foundation, Eni Mattei Foundation. It's a general equilibrium model covering the rest of  the world. It's not a model as good as what Jorgen showed yesterday but it shows the possible\n","28.54 - 34.93 min\n"," interactions with different elements. We have built 28 indicators that are close to the SDGs  and we have used last year for Italy for example this model to show the business as usual,  the policy scenarios and especially what we have demonstrated is that changing policies we can  improve the situation but to a certain extent. And the most important element is that the model  provides you with trade-offs showing how the simultaneous implementation of policies  can change the trade-offs and reduce the overall cost of moving towards 230. So we are pushing now  the government to do the same because our model is not very far from what they are doing. Now  let me go to the European level. I've been a consultant to the cabinet of President Juncker  and now other DGs and also the parliament trying to have some of the parties who will run  for the next elections using the Agenda 2030 as the framework. So I'm very happy to be here. I'm  sorry that I'm not in Brussels today to finalize the report on these issues that will be published  soon and I'm very pleased to report that some of the political forces in the parliament, especially  in the current political situation with populists and so on, are happy or trying to understand how  to use the Agenda 2030 to design their platform, their manifesto and their policy. There are many  ways in which the EU can do it and I'm very proud or happy to be European because in the Treaty  of the European Union, sustainable development is quoted twice, both to drive internal policies  and to drive policies' external relations with the rest of the country. Now the problem is how to make  it practical. This is why I, using Bob Costanza and others' famous chart, I added  one small box which links the different elements. What I added is the so-called social  system services, similar to the ecosystem services, because the wastes that we are producing are not  only physical but also human. If you put on this chart the 17 goals, you don't think anymore  of the SDGs as a list, but as a complex plan to change the different pieces of the system.  Now, how can we make it attractive to policymakers? The rest of my presentation, I don't have time,  sorry for that, talks about this. But just if I have one minute, not more, to conclude. By the way,  we have built also indicators for European countries. On our database you have all the  composite indicators for countries. The point is that you'll never be elected if you just say the  world is going to collapse. That is the truth. You have to provide solutions, you have to provide  a vision. Now, what we have built with the European Commission, with the JRC, is a vision that is  built around shocks. Small shocks, large shocks, big shocks. And so the transformation is part of the  policies that we need to build to make this work in the future. Let me just conclude.  In this way, we can put aside the classical separation of economic policies, social policies,  environmental policies, and we can try to use these five keywords. Prevent, prepare, protect,  promote, transform. If you use this that we developed at the UN in 2014 with the UNDP report,  you can think about integrated policies that overcome the classical silos. So the good thing  is that people are now looking for this kind of solutions. Let me go to the last slide that you  can read by yourself. We are scared of populism, we are scared of emerging fascism, we are scared  of many things. But the good thing is that there isn't only one way to do it. There are many ways  to fight against this. And I quote this from the political brain from Drew Weston, a great book  that I would recommend you to read, where we can, looking at facts, science, build a narrative  that will rescue our countries, our regions, our world. Thank you very much.  Thank you Enrico, it's so impressive what's happening here. Really a great presentation, thank you.  So Xinfeng Zhu will give us another perspective now, coming from China, what's happening on that  side of the world? I would like to introduce a few areas we are doing among others about SDG.  And first is GEP. Together with IUCN and the Chinese Academy of Science, we developed a set  of methodology and applied to some areas of China, that is gross ecosystem product.  Instead of GDP, we set up this concept and applied to areas to encourage local officials  to consider more about the ecosystem, about water, about air, about forestry, about those  ecosystems. We are working to apply this to several areas. It's got a great success. Local governments  are not that much worried about a new set of manufacturing. They are concerned about the  environments, they are concerned about the ecological system. And this methodology is already accepted\n","34.93 - 42.12 min\n"," by central government. So that is not the only, now GDP is not the only standard  local officials are concerned. Now GEP is also a major concern that makes a fundamental change,  because in China the government has very strong influence over economy, over industries.  Through this, we point a new area and this is what we have done. Second, we call it CCEFA.  In 2016, a few hundred birds called great bastard landed at the Yellow River banks.  Those birds in the whole world only have a few hundreds, but those birds do not know where is the  state protected area. The birds do not know. So they just landed at the Yellow River bank.  Some Chinese people started to hunt them. My volunteers found this truth, want to protect them.  They go to the government, the government say, oh we need three years to evaluate, to see if it's possible.  And we need more years to set up the state protected area. So my foundation, when we heard that,  the next morning, that's 2016 April 18th, we give them the certificate, we give the panel,  we give them a name called China Conservation Area for Great Bastard. That's the bird's name.  At Changyuan, that's the county's name. Through that, with our certificate, they go to the police,  go to the government, it works great well. And in that year, no single bird hurt or left in that area.  During the spring, all of them fly back to Russia, to Mongolia, to the bank. Starting that day, about  two years ago, now we have over 80 protect, we call it CCEFA. CCEF in the whole world,  in whole China, we already have over 80 CCEFA to protect all those wildlife, to protect those fish,  birds, everything. That's another creative activity of Newhouse Dunn and make a great success.  The third I would like to introduce is EPIL, Environmental Public Interest Litigation.  According to new environmental law of China, in fact, in 2015, social organizations can participate  through the polluter on behalf of public interest. And we start that, we take that to immediately,  to the day we found almost 100 cases nationwide to sue local government, to sue state enterprises,  as well as private enterprise, to protect the environment and the ecological surroundings.  For example, we sued the state investment corporation to stop them to build a hydraulic  power station, because with that power station, the river, the fish, the ecosystem will be destroyed.  We successfully stopped that huge project. Another example is for green energy. We have in China, we  have many wind energy, solar energy, but because the development is too fast, many of them cannot be  connected to the grid, state grid. So some of them, a big portion, say 40 percent, are lost,  just because it was not connected to the grid, state grid. So we also filed a case against the  state grid. That may change dramatically. And the next example is Pangolin, the Pangolin scale.  And because of TCM issues, Chinese, according to China, from a copier of China, the Pangolin scale  is TCM, traditional Chinese medicine. So because of that, although we have the law to protect the  Pangolins, but still, Chinese Pangolins are gone after 20 years of protection.  Now, we, together with our volunteers, we do study, find out the problem. We filed a litigation  against the Guangxi autonomous government, administration of forest in charge of this sector,  and we find out they sent some confiscated Pangolin and scale to pharmaceutical company,  to trading company. And then, through our activity, that make a big shock nationwide. Now, officials  related, companies related, stop. That kind of, I'm not saying 100 percent, but it's really a big shock.  That's the third area we're working on. The fourth is, we have a Guangxi program 20 years ago,  which we provide policy supports to encourage private enterprises to invest in the poor area,  but instead of simply giving them money, we encourage them to start business there. Through  this, we get 20 million Chinese get out of poverty for the last 20 years. And at the same time,  we get many tens of thousands private enterprises get very good. And for those who think we are doing  good, come on, join us to make it better. For those who think China is not doing good,  come on, join us, make it good. And on this occasion, I'm proud to announce an important  agreement to advance the vision of the Club of Rome in essential global and very public area,  linking climate-friendly travel, conservation, and growing development. It's between two members of  the Club of Rome, myself and my friend Jeffrey Liebman, and who runs a foundation which is a  legacy to our mentor and very close friend, Mr. Maurice Strong, one of the fathers of  sustainability thinking action. The Strong Universal Network is promoting climate-friendly\n","42.12 - 49.87 min\n"," travel. We will develop our network in China and around the world. And through strong climate  action events and build our moments of bright young climate champions ready to sustain the change  we need. Thank you.  Thank you, Jinfeng. I'm just so reminded of that old saying that, you know, change changes as it  changes. And when we're trying to find solutions and lock into them, you know, the birds don't know  where the preservation areas are, and the birds are going to new places. So this task is made  extra challenging by that process, and I'm so curious to hear more about that.  Our next speaker is one of our co-presidents, Manfela,  can tell us some of what's happening in the African continent.  Okay. I want to return us to where we left off before we went to lunch.  We had this very interesting conversation about what kind of civilization. I just want to return  all of you to the cradle of humanity where all of us come from, Africa. Africa is not just the  cradle of humanity in terms of the physical human evolution, but also in terms of it being the first  place where human civilization emerged. And I think there are some lessons from how  the human race evolved in a space which was untouched by, obviously, other beings other than  beings other than the natural environment of which you were a part. And I think  there is much wisdom to be learned from how was it possible that we evolved amongst the  lions, amongst all of the predators that were around us, because there were no  camps. And I think this realization is beginning to dawn on biologists. And I want to remind you  of a beautiful saying in a book by Andreas Weber, who asked us to take seriously  in his book, The Biology of Wonder, as a scientific fact, the idea that the natural world  is not comprised of biological machines. It's a sensuous, pulsating reality.  And his words, which I think I can't improve on, are, in the ecological commons,  a multitude of different individuals and diverse species stand in various relations with one  another, competition, cooperation, partnership, predation, productivity, and destruction.  All these relations, however, follow one higher law, which is, over the long run,  only behavior that allows for productivity of the whole ecosystem, and that does not  interrupt itself, production is amplified. The individual can only realize itself  if the whole can realize itself. Ecological freedom obeys this form of necessity.  The deeper the connections in the system, the more creative niches it will afford  for its individual members. And in my continent, we call this Ubuntu,  the I see you in me and you see me in you. And this relational construct, this philosophical  orientation that ties us together inextricably, that I can't call myself human unless I recognize  your humanity, this is profound. In this approach, if we were to return to it, not as a slogan,  but as a lived reality, I think we'll be able to answer the question,  by what values should we be governing the economic commons?  The sad reality is because we departed from this, that the commons, which is the wildlife,  the beautiful landscapes of the African continent, has been decimated. I think it was Herbie who  said that Julius Caesar looked at North Africa and saw a food basket, and therefore created  decimation which led to the Saharan Desert, and of course, desertification continues.  The question we have to answer as we deal with this reality and the tool that has been afforded  by the SDGs is, how are we going to heal the wounds that were inflicted on this cradle of humanity,  which is an ecosystem today that probably has the most unique species of wildlife, trees,  and has the potential to be the lung for this planet that is suffocating from the pollution?  And I want to, in considering this issue of how do we heal this cradle of humanity,  I want to read you a poem from a book that was given to me this morning by Daisaku Akeda.  I can't pronounce it properly, but here is the poem. A mountain represents its people.  Nature represents its people. Landscapes are mirrors presenting people's hearts.  Just as gardens offer images of their homeowner's hearts, landscapes reflect the hearts of their  citizens. I bring to you bleeding hearts from my continent. Someone was telling me at lunchtime\n","49.87 - 57.86 min\n"," that there are plans to drill into wetlands in one of the African countries in return for rents of  600 million dollars a year. There is no price you can attach to those wetlands, but that's going to  happen unless we, the people, we, the global community, recognize that for as long as Africa's  natural resources have no value, they are not calculated in the GDP of the world, and our  politicians take the first 600 million and sell a totally irreplaceable ecosystem to the highest bidder.  And you and I are responsible as stewards of that heritage that we owe not just to our children's  but to the future generations that deserve better. And I believe we have the capacity if our mindset  shifts from what can we do for them to saying what can we do for us. Thank you.  Thank you.  I'd like to open it up to the room now and see what comes up. This time, could I have  some assistance please in figuring out who to choose for these comments?  I think there was one over here first and then after that can you please just find the next person.  No, here. Thanks very much, very enlightening. I would like to ask a question to Hans and Enrico.  Ecological economists famously differentiate two worldviews, the weak and strong sustainability,  meaning that in under weak sustainability all the trade-offs are allowed. You could exchange  some economic growth for some life expectancy, for some birds, for some CO2 emissions reduction.  Under strong sustainability this is not allowed. So you're slightly more conservative but you're  prepared to accept improvement across the board, maybe smaller improvement. I would like to ask  how is the differentiation between the strong and weak sustainability  is addressed in your models, as the geo-related of course.  Take a couple more questions. I would like to please request that you keep your comments as  quickly as possible, as short as possible. Thank you. Thank you so much Noraz, thank you so much  to the panel. I just want to mention something that somehow is missing in this conference,  which is Latin America. I would like to link this with the SDGs, not just in the case of Latin  America but in particular in the case of Mexico. For instance, we cannot talk about one Mexico.  There are many Mexicos in Mexico. So the SDGs can work in a very different way in the north  of the country than in the south. We have states that they grow seven percent per year,  six percent in the north, but in the south, in Central America and Latin America,  there are some states that they grow zero percent or less than zero percent.  And with this broken society, as Manfiela said, and with these birds that that Jinjin just mentioned,  how they go from one place to the other, not just the birds that are coming from Canada to Mexico,  but also the birds that are in Mexico City, they are threatened by civilization. So how can we do  to open our hearts in a different way in order to have a much equitable development? Because  it's not a matter of growth, it's a matter of development as well, and also as part of  education, like a solution of civilization. So I want to have your feelings about that.  Okay, being the oldest member of the Club of Rome entitles you to be a little longer than  one minute. First of all, we heard about the need for finances for the  environmental crisis all over the world. Federico Mayor, the former director of UNESCO, sent us a  note yesterday evening. Some of you have read it. The world is spending today four billion dollars  in arms every day. My God, if we can change that, four billion dollars a day. Now, how can we change  that? If we can, there'll be money for environmental crisis. Second, I'd like to mention, because  Manfiela mentioned Africa, I did this before. A friend here knows about my thinking. You know,  in Brazil, we have 210 million people today. In the city of Brasilia, which was created  12 years before the Club of Rome, we have today, and it was designed for 700,000 people,  today it's 2.8 million people, 1.3 million cars. That's incredible. Okay, if we have those cars,  they will have gasoline, CO2 will be up there. But we don't forget, we have something called ethanol.  Some people don't believe in ethanol. Okay, ethanol is produced from sugar cane in Brazil. In the  United States, from corn. Okay, ethanol today employs in Brazil 2 million people producing  ethanol all over the country. We produce enough ethanol that today I have two cars, one mine,  my wife. Each car runs on 27% ethanol. All cars of the country. I'm not talking a small number.\n","57.86 - 64.71 min\n"," So why don't you consider that? How can we then help Africa to develop ethanol? Because it's for  sugar cane, it would produce food, it would export, you could export to Europe, to Asia. So it's a  fantastic possibility, but nothing has really been done strongly on that. There's a movement from Brazil  to the BRAPA formulation, and I think we can help. So it would be a good idea if Manfiela  could take this message to other countries in Africa. Thank you.  This section began with beautiful music, and it ended with beautiful words.  Beauty is a decisive dimension. When astronauts see our planet from outside,  they see the beauty of the planet, the only living planet in the known cosmos.  And they immediately find wonderful words, words of love for the planet.  It's the same what I said before. We need more loving beauty, loving our planet,  loving landscape, loving people, and loving animals and plants. Thank you.  In the International Monetary Fund, as I understand it, so-called developed nations  have about 60 percent of the votes, because they're given out by GDP, but they have about  15 percent of the world population. Would you all commit to agreeing to the statement that we  should democratize the IMF?  Let's take the panel a little bit, and then we'll get back to the questions.  Anybody want to respond immediately to any of that?  Let me start with the oldest member of the club. I think my limited knowledge about ethanol is that  it's bad news for the environment, and I wouldn't want us to get there. We have God's sun,  plenty of wind, and we've got two oceans plus the Mediterranean Sea, which is full of seaweed.  We need to use nature as is and not, because the sugarcane is an alien plant,  and therefore it has its impact. So I think I appreciate your interest in helping us, but  we've got to first leverage the natural resources and turn them into assets.  The second point is I couldn't agree with you more about beauty being an asset, and I think if we  forget the beauty, and what keeps me going on my continent is I think it's got some of the most  breathtaking places, and when you see the majesty or the majestic nature of a rhino or an elephant,  you just weep with joy and so on. The billions for the arms, I think that's a subject for  mobilization of citizens against those who are the arms dealers.  Yes, on the question of weak and strong sustainability, I think that we are clearly  asymmetric. Now, thanks to the work done by Joachim Rockström and many others, we have an idea of what  kind of thresholds we have on the environmental side, but we don't have a clue on what is the social,  what are the social thresholds. Personally speaking, I'm very worried about environmental  unsustainability, but we will crash well before for social unsustainability.  And this is something, maybe because I was minister of labor and social policies, and this is where we  can do immediately much more than what we could do and we must do on the environmental side.  Now, the point is that social policies are seen as coming after the economic  policies, and this takes us in a completely wrong direction, as we did with the environmental  points. Here, I think that the issue of inequalities is huge, of course, and then  we must mobilize at least those politicians who want to go in the opposite direction of the  direction that we took over the last few years. Unfortunately, in Europe, this is not the mainstream,  so this is why the work on new economics is so important, in order to show how the different  unsustainabilities are coming together and creating a non-linear situation, exactly like  the non-sustainability on the environmental side is creating non-linearities. But as I try to  explain, this is very hard to sell to politicians. And if you wish, we will come back as a club or  another time, when we are trying to build on what we are trying to build as a positive message,  not a rosy message, but integrating this work on resilience, instead of just building walls  to avoid shocks. This is, if you wish, the alternative that we have before us.  Hans and then Petra.  Okay. I think seeing is believing, and that's why I think when you use models who have the capacity  to visualize different scenarios, that's how you can actually show people what would happen if they\n","64.71 - 71.61 min\n"," would do this, that, or something else, being in the economic sector, the social, or the environmental.  I think that's why we have these models. They're not perfect, but I think they would show the  trends very quickly. And so, whatever choices you make, or you think you should make, and then you  can see it, oh, going the right direction or not, depending on what you want. And, you know, there's  a saying back in Switzerland, there's many ways to roam. And I think that's actually the point,  because you can go over the Alps, then you have to be equipped. We have to have the right tires,  the right car, or something, or you can go around, and then you can go maybe even on foot.  You have to know which road you are, so you can measure progress. You're also going to go to Rome.  And I think the different routes are different politics. There are different choices which you  can take. But that has to be done, again, with the stakeholders. People have to be,  we're sitting together, and look at this together, so that they actually can concentrate on what  they want to do. And that's the same for arms. It's part of the budget, so, all right, you can  spend more money on guns, and then you have less money to do something else, because it's a finite  pot. And I think that's what I think would allow people to make better decisions. And I want to  agree here with Montfélié about this whole issue of ethanol. You know, I'm in agriculture  a lot, and I know what Embrapa is doing in Africa. I think wrong direction, large-scale agriculture,  chemicals. I mean, that's producing things we don't need. More sugar cane. We need to get off  the fossil fuels, and even the non-fossil, but they use water, land, which we actually want to  preserve for our birds and all by diversity, not just plow everything and produce more.  Because, as we know, you build more roads, you have more cars. You produce more ethanol, you're  going to have more cars soon. So, I think these are societal choices. We need to decide what do  we want. And I think that the way to do this is really to look at our future using tools people  have developed ever since Jay Forrester started with those system models. I think that's, that  we have them, so let's use them.  Petra. Yeah, I would like to pick up the beauty, because the beauty is extremely important,  and we completely neglect it. Because without the arts, of course, we wouldn't survive. And  Montfélié was quoting Andreas Ohl, referring to Andreas Weber. He's a German biologist,  a semi-biologist, a very, very interesting read, The Biology of Wonder, because what he  says is that we are totally and utterly dependent on nature, and not in a rational thing, but in an  emotional relationship. So, we are interconnected with beauty, and we know this in our relationship,  or if it is absent, we also notice that. And we notice it when we feel it in nature, and all of us  at some stage go to a beach or a wonderful sunset, or, you know, we nourish ourselves with  beauty. And the interesting thing is that this, it is so extremely important in SDG implementation to  overcome the split between what Ken Wilber says, wonderland and flatland, because we are operating  in flatland, and there is all the rational models and the implementation plans, and nothing is wrong  about it. It's right. We need targets, that's perfectly all right, but we need to bring the  humanity aspect, the beauty aspect, in, and not as an addition, not as, you know, kind of, you know,  kind of a nice picture, or, you know, like, we need to fully integrate these aspects into our  planning. There need to be integrated plannings that integrate flatland and wonderland aspects.  So my encouragement, or my, you know, like, my offer is, as I'm heading the Club of Rome  initiative on new enlightenment, or new civilization, new humanism, etc., is to say, let's get into a  conversation how these models that you have developed, or other models, could integrate  the wonderland aspect that is so extremely important for our transformations.  Just one word on arms. I know that this is an unintended consequence, but if a politician looks  at these trends and doesn't believe that we can turn up, building arms is a very rational choice.  So what I want to say is that either we are able to show a pathway which is feasible,  and then you can decide not to use money for arms, but for transferring your technologies  to something else, or we shouldn't be, we shouldn't be naive. A lot of people who are  very worried about their future are buying arms, and maybe you have read on the, I think, New York  Times or Guardian, that some people are building bunkers in New Zealand to be sold to very rich\n","71.61 - 77.03 min\n"," people in the Silicon Valley. So this is happening, and this is of course not a solution,  maybe for them, but I don't know. But we must be coherent, and we shouldn't be just naive saying  we shouldn't spend money on arms, because that is a very rational behavior, unfortunately, if we  believe with the Club of Rome limits of growth original plans that we are going to have a collapse.  So people are defending them. As Zygmunt Bauman said, the retrotopia that we are observing  around us is the utopia or going back, not going ahead, but just going back,  is a reality around us, because if we are not successful and convincing on the fact that we can  move towards this green scenario, people will prepare themselves to the worst scenario, and  this will just accelerate the problem. And the social side is what is accelerating everything,  because people vote, and therefore politicians are interested in keeping their power.  Let's start with Anders.  Thank you. Thank you for this discussion, and I'm very happy to see that both Enrico and Hans,  that you have developed models that aim at policy integration and to moving away from the  silo mentality that still dominates so much. And I think Yifeng is aiming at that also.  My question is, having heard Johan Rockström and Jürgen Randers yesterday in their, I think,  very interesting report, I think what they point at is that conventional growth will not make it,  and that incrementalism will not make it. We need bold decisions aiming at transformation  of sectors, of policies, and Jürgen alluded to it this morning. I don't have to repeat it.  My question is, within your respective domains of work and responsibility,  how will you try to act upon this call for transformational change?  That, I think, is a very, very important question.  Thank you. Maybe I just try to link with that kind of question. China, on one hand,  is following all the Westerns doing. So China is actually an experimental field nowadays, I think.  How many people have been to China? Can you raise a hand? Wow. How many people have  cooperation with China projects? Wow. Can we find a way to link all these projects and link  that with the SDG 17? And that makes China a brilliant way to demonstrate, which just  Anders mentioned about. Is that okay?  Heiner Benking, Global Commons Alliance, and with the Council of Global Issues in Toronto.  I applaud the design of this panel, because it really, after 20 years with Bertrand Schneider  on media and policy, we are coming to constructive ways to really do the interlinkages,  and not just with words or images, but integral. So you see, we play with young people with  three-dimensional SDGs. With Tony Judge, we do it since two years. How to address the  intersectorial strategic dilemmas was before Rio. So that is the bifurcations of what you  were mentioning. What I want to say is, how can we make it solid? How can we make it concrete  and I think then we have to look into what are models. There are scale models, there are immersive  models, and I think we have to step out of the box. Not just flat land, color land, future land,  but really integrating the ice, integrating the scales, and making it concrete. I see  since 40 years some improvements here. This is really a spark of hope that we leave the  dilemmas of the ego and come to really multi-stakeholders. And I think as we have seen  the chance after 50 years, now sinking into the old idea of bringing the women, the arts,  the children, the indigenous people in, as we tried the linkage between the Club of Rome and  Club of Budapest. I think this should be something to revisit the early reports of the Club of Rome,  predicament of mankind. And I really invite you to keep on tracking and invest into the  leverage points according to Donella Meadows and expand the solution spaces.  Thank you. So we'll take two more questions, one from the back. I can't,  whoever, and then one up here from the front.  I don't know. I try to keep it varied.  Yeah, so I work for a systemic firm that tries to catalyze system change. And we are a lot about  actions, not only talk. And building on the Millennium Institute beautiful model on  really measuring and trying to do radical incremental change. I want to ask you,\n","77.03 - 83.66 min\n"," what are the concrete steps that the Club of Rome, which is influenced, can take today,  this week, and this month to make sure that the model by the Millennium Institute  get implemented in as many countries as possible, as soon as possible. And I think that would be  a tremendous step to get to the radical change that Anders just referred to. Thank you very much.  Thank you.  This is part of the reflections of this morning. And we've thanked Aurelio Pichet, the founder,  and his co-conspirator Alexander King. But we've heard very little about the woman who wrote  Limits to Growth and did many of the algorithms. And I think we should pay a tribute to her,  Danella Meadows.  I think we should take some more comments from the panel if someone wants to respond.  I should answer to Anders. One, in terms of policies, I think that we have to go towards  minimum income subject to reactivation of people. So it's not universal income, but it's minimum  income subject to reactivation. And circular economy are the two key words. But let me tell  you what I'm trying to do in the World Commission on the Future of Work that I'm part of at the ILO.  When I was at the OECD, as a statistician, I managed to change the rules for GDP worldwide,  including, for example, research and development as an investment. At the time, it was considered  as a cost. And now everybody's counting this as an investment. What I'm trying to do – I failed  15 years ago on this – is to count people as part of the assets of the companies. They're  counted, as you know, as a cost. And there is no way to have in future enough money for training,  continuous training, if we do not change this. Because every euro or dollar used for training  reduces profits. Now, with the Commission, we are trying to understand why is so and how we can  change it. And we looked at the international business accounting rules, which say that people  are not an asset of the companies because they are not completely under the control of the company.  Therefore, they are a cost. And this was done in order to mark the difference from the time when  they were part of the assets, when they were slaves. When people were slaves, they were counted  as assets. And now they're counted as cost. So we are trying to change this. And I think that this  And I think that this would be a fundamental shift in the way in which we evaluate companies'  behaviours, but also the way in which we look at public budgets, because again,  investments, the whole call of investments in education and training is current expenditure.  So we will finalise this report by the beginning of the year, on the occasion of the 100th  anniversary of the ILO. I hope that the Commission will adopt this proposal. We are working on it.  This would be, I think, a big shift also to achieve the goal four, but also to help people  to adapt to the huge changes that technologies and so on. There is no way to have a circular economy  applied to people. See what I mean? That now we finally understand we have to recycle  stuff, but not people. This is just to say how old-fashioned we are, or late. And if we can  change that rule, maybe it will be much easier also to move towards a full circular economy,  including people.  So everything that I am wearing is probably made possible through exploitation. Most of the items  on this counter are made possible through exploitation and extraction. To get to lunch  every day in our lives, we require an interaction with an agriculture system, an economy,  a manufacturing system, a distribution system, a political system, an education system,  an employment system, all of which are apparently organised and run through institutions that have  failed to address what Sandrine was addressing earlier, not only the corruption, but the right  somehow, as Chandan was referring to, to exploitation, the right to profit, the right  to that extraction. I live in Sweden, and on your chart, Sweden's looking pretty good.  But most of the things I buy in Sweden are not. They're not made there. They're not grown there.  And I'm not sure how to begin to think about that, except for that in my own work with the SDGs,  to begin to really ask sort of the question that was coming from over here about the intersections,  and to ask hard questions. How is gender equality related to the health of the oceans?  How is it that those two things are actually not two separate projects?\n","83.66 - 90.29 min\n"," What is the connection? What is that interdependency, the sense-making, the rational  world in which it makes sense for those forms of exploitation to take place across all these  different sectors? Is it so different? And how can we begin to generate information  that gives us that relational, contextual process in a way that is actually accessible?  It doesn't seem like some abstract theoretical complexity, because, like you said,  you have to pitch this to politicians and school kids, both, and moms.  So I guess for me, one of the most interesting things that has come up around this is this  recognition that there's a shock, and that one of the SDGs that isn't on the list is shock.  Yeah, because it's in every single one of them. If we achieve any of them, we're talking systems  change, and that's going to be radical. So, yeah.  Yeah, talking about radical change, I have one example which shows also we can play out,  actually, in the model, which comes out quite according to what we would expect,  is agriculture and the food system. It's not going to be good enough just to do a little bit of things  here and there. No way. And already 10 years ago, in the famous agricultural report of the UN,  which I was the co-chair of, we already warned that we need a radical change of paradigm.  That I think we coined the term at that time, business as usual is not an option. I mean,  that was across the whole report. Well, actually, it's true. If you try to model small changes in  agriculture, you can see that you're never going to meet the targets of an agriculture who is  climate neutral, and actually even takes carbon down into the ground again, which we have released  over the years, and certainly in the last 100 and some years since we invented the plow,  which is the dumbest thing humanity has ever invented. A lot of people think different,  but actually that's exactly what agriculture today is, based on a technology which should have been  discarded long ago. So, we know that in that case, we need a transformational system, but  the transformation has to happen actually at the other end, at the consumption, the diet,  and what do people buy. Farmers will continue to produce what people buy. So, actually,  you have to go and understand the behavior, and then you have to have a behavior change,  and that will actually then trickle down. At the same time, we have to do more research  in alternatives to green revolution. That model is long past. It's still being promoted by most  development agencies, the African World Bank, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation. The big  money in agriculture still goes in this antiquated model. It's mind-boggling,  and we know that we need a real radical shift in paradigm, and again, maybe the only thing we can  do is to show them, right, that we use models, whatever they are, and they have to see it,  and I think that's what we're trying to do, and those models are actually, they are based on  science, the best we can find, but also on knowledge and experience, and that's why you  actually rebuild those models with the communities you work with, and that is not only at national  level. Those models now are actually used at regional level, sort of below state, and down  to communities, because in the end, the communities will be the ones who are actually  going to get this SDG going. We have a framework, a legal framework on top, policies, but who is  going to do the work? And I think that's where we may have to make sure that the SDGs become  common knowledge, so we have to go to schools with this thing, so everybody knows. If in my  own country, Switzerland, you go down the street with the microphone, about 10% of people maybe  know what you're talking about, three years after the own government has said we're going to do it.  I mean, the media don't give a damn about it, frankly. You never read anything in the papers,  unless your president goes and gets blamed for zero results like ours. I mean, so there is  something there. We have to understand that it is not going to happen by itself, no matter how  well-intentioned we may be, or what we know about how to do it. I think we really have to make sure  that those messages, whatever also what we do here at the Club of Rome, it really has to go to the people,  to the communities.  I think going to the community is exactly what is needed. Angus made a point, and I think  Chandra also made the point that if, sorry, oh, that there was a point raised this morning that if we\n","90.33 - 95.81 min\n"," were to make sure everybody has got access to a decent house, we just won't have the materials  to be able to do it. I've got news for you. The African continent figured out how to have sustainable  regenerative building materials hundreds of thousands years ago, but because that's not seen  as civilized, it has been forgotten. I think that's the reason why I'm so passionate about  the abuse of this term enlightenment, because people were enlightened enough then to know  that rondevels were the best configuration of architecture, that you use grass or such roofs  that actually insulate you, but all of that is forgotten. So I really think that in the process  of pursuing the SDGs and pursuing the models, we need to go back to what really matters to people,  their sense of dignity and their sense of belonging and connectedness. I forgot to respond  to the issue of the IMF. I think that is a task on your generation's shoulders, because the Bretton  Woods institutions are past sell by date, but there are too many interested people, and Europe is really  at the center of it together with America, of continuing to keep alive post-second world war  institutions that have really lost much of their value. The IMF, for example, is so tiny as a  financial institution that it really doesn't, it should just be a knowledge institution to give  kind of data, but then they need the information to help to aggregate global knowledge with the  new economic models and so on. So I really think that the IMF, the World Bank and the UN Security  Council are archaic institutions, but they are absorbing billions of dollars every year, keeping  people living in Washington who should be living at home and flying in for meetings.  Latin America, the issue that was raised as well, which I forgot to respond to, I really believe that  we need to keep, particularly the Club of Rome, our eye very open to the diversity and the wealth  that comes from that diversity in terms of understanding complexity. You cannot understand  the world without understanding, because Latin America is also part of the old civilizations, way before Europe  knew how to spell the words.
